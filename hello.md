This one's binary, which Git doesn't try to render in human-readable diff (unless you're Neo or a hex editor in disguise).

It just tells you that the contents changed between the versions ‚Äî or it's a completely new file.

The actual diff of binary files isn't shown, because Git assumes you'd rather not decode machine gibberish byte-by-byte.

Which stashes uncommitted changes not staged, keeping the staged stuff ready to go. Like putting some cookies in the jar and stashing the rest in your secret snack drawer.

Want to go full Git wizard? We can talk about the index vs HEAD vs working tree. Or how to stage specific lines. Or even how to use Git like a time machine with git restore --source.

Let me know how deep you want to go! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
